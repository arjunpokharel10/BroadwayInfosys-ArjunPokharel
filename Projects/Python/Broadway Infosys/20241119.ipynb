    " - Programming in itself isn't hard. What is hard is to learn patterns. \n",
    " - List vs Tuple [why use tuple over list, or vice-versa, these are fundamentals. Learn fundamentals and you will be solid.]\n",
    " - Be laser focued on at least the first 20 days of this class. This is crucial. \n",
    " - We will be learning \"Software Engineering\" fundamentals, not just Python. So, be laser focused on this class, and you can learn whatever language you want later. \n",
    " - Learn to solve problems yourself, if you reply on someone else to fix your mistakes, you will never learn. Avoid chatGPT etc. for now. \n",
    " - Try to solve errors for at least 30 mins. If you can't solve within 30 mins - you can look for documentations, stackoverflow, geeks4geeks, github and so on - then you can look elsewhere, such as chatGPT, even then try not to get solution. \n",
    " - We actually learn when we are trying to fix something.  \n",
    " - Focus in fundamentals. Sit with errors. Learn to get comfortable with boredome (while trying to figure out probelems)\n",
    " - Regular expressions. Pattern matching. (Advanced). \n",
    " - Some fundamentals to make it your second nature:\n",
    "    - Pattern recognition\n",
    "    - Variables\n",
    "    - Classes\n",
    "    - Functions\n",
